#Summary: 
Elastic is an NFT Renting Marketplace where listers can highlight the benefits gained form renting their NFT. The Dashboard tracks the progress of each rental and ensures a timely return. 

#The Renting Protocol: 
The app uses a collaterailized deposit (the amount is decided upon by the rental lister) as insurance at the outset of each agreement. A rental lister also decide upon the amount of rent they would like to charge per day.

At the end of the timeperiod for a rental if the renter does not pay the rental charge and does not return the NFT the lister has the option of collecting the collateral deposit via their personalized dashboard within the app.

#IPFS Incorperation:
Upon the successful completion of a rental both the rentee and lister get a receipt from IPFS which can be used for accounting purposes.
