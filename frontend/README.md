# Elastic's Frontend

The frontend has basically 4 pages: Homes, List, Search, and Dashboard.

## Home

On the Home page, there is some explanation about what our protocol does and how it works as well as the tools offered.

## List

On this page, the user can list one of his/her NFTs to be rented through the protocol. First, the user needs to connect his/her wallet to the dApp, simply by clicking on the "Connect wallet" button at the top-right corner of the page, in the header.

## Search

Here, the user can search for NFTs to rent. The search tab allows the user to search by the benefits of the NFTs, so that he/she can get the desired benefit during the rental period.

## Dashboard

This page only shows up when the user connects his/her wallet. On this page, every listed and rented (borrowed or lended) NFTs are shown. The user can unlist the NFTs as well as return the borrowed ones whenever needed and withdraw the collateral amount after the renting period if the NFT has not been returned yet.

Here is also shown the receipts for every rental that the user is involved: as the owner or as the borrower of the NFT. The receipts are automatically generated after the rental end and they are stored on IPFS for accounting purposes.
